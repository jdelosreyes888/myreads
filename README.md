# MyReads Project for Udacity FEND

This is the solution I made for the Udacity's MyReads Project.  The project arranges the books according to the users preferences.  This can be Already Read, Want to Read, and Currently Read.  The project also has the functionality to search for books that can be added to the users book shelves.

## Starting the MyReads Project

To start the MyReads Project:
* Clone the repository to your local machine
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
